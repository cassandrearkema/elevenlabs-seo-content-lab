# ElevenLabs SEO Content Lab

This repository is a public work log of how I plan, write, and improve SEO content for technical products, with a focus on AI audio.

I use GitHub as a lightweight way to show process: research → intent mapping → content briefs → drafts → iteration. The goal is content that wins the click, satisfies intent, and supports product adoption.

## What you’ll find here

- Briefs that show keyword choice, SERP intent, angle, and internal linking plans
- Draft articles written in Markdown with on-page optimization notes
- A practical LLM workflow for scaling content without losing accuracy or voice

## How I work

I start from search intent and product reality, not “SEO tricks.”
I care about:
- matching the reason someone searched
- making the page useful fast
- connecting content to product actions without stuffing CTAs

## Proof of impact

I’ve led content and growth work tied to measurable outcomes, including multi-site traffic growth and campaign-driven lifts.
Where I can share clean examples publicly, I document them here with methodology and constraints.

## Contact

If you’re reviewing this for an SEO Content Marketer role, this repo is meant to be a quick scan.
I’m happy to walk through the brief-to-draft workflow live.
